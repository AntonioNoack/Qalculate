/* SchÃ¶nhage's rules:
 *
 * Assume r0 = r1 q1 + r2, with r0 odd, and r1 = q2 r2 + r3
 *
 * If r1 is odd, then
 *
 *   (r1 | r0) = s(r1, r0) (r0 | r1) = s(r1, r0) (r2, r1)
 *
 * where s(x,y) = (-1)^{(x-1)(y-1)/4} = (-1)^[x = y = 3 (mod 4)].
 *
 * If r1 is even, r2 must be odd. We have
 *
 *   (r1 | r0) = (r1 - r0 | r0) = (-1)^(r0-1)/2 (r0 - r1 | r0)
 *             = (-1)^(r0-1)/2 s(r0, r0 - r1) (r0 | r0 - r1)
 *             = (-1)^(r0-1)/2 s(r0, r0 - r1) (r1 | r0 - r1)
 *
 * Now, if r1 = 0 (mod 4), then the sign factor is +1, and repeating
 * q1 times gives
 *
 *   (r1 | r0) = (r1 | r2) = (r3 | r2)
 *
 * On the other hand, if r1 = 2 (mod 4), the sign factor is
 * (-1)^{(r0-1)/2}, and repeating q1 times gives the exponent
 *
 *   (r0-1)/2 + (r0-r1-1)/2 + ... + (r0 - (q1-1) r1)/2
 *   = q1 (r0-1)/2 + q1 (q1-1)/2
 *
 * and we can summarize the even case as
 *
 *   (r1 | r0) = t(r1, r0, q1) (r3 | r2)
 *
 * where t(x,y,q) = (-1)^{[x = 2 (mod 4)] (q(y-1)/2 + y(q-1)/2)}
 *
 * What about termination? The remainder sequence ends with (0|1) = 1
 * (or (0 | r) = 0 if r != 1). What are the possible cases? If r1 is
 * odd, r2 may be zero. If r1 is even, then r2 = r0 - q1 r1 is odd and
 * hence non-zero. We may have r3 = r1 - q2 r2 = 0.
 *
 * Examples: (11|15) = - (15|11) = - (4|11)
 *            (4|11) =    (4| 3) =   (1| 3)
 *            (1| 3) = (3|1) = (0|1) = 1
 *
 *             (2|7) = (2|1) = (0|1) = 1
 *
 * Detail:     (2|7) = (2-7|7) = (-1|7)(5|7) = -(7|5) = -(2|5)
 *             (2|5) = (2-5|5) = (-1|5)(3|5) =  (5|3) =  (2|3)
 *             (2|3) = (2-3|3) = (-1|3)(1|3) = -(3|1) = -(2|1)

/* In principle, the state consists of four variables: e (one bit), a,
   b (two bits each), d (one bit). Collected factors are (-1)^e. a and
   b are the least significant bits of the current remainders. d
   (denominator) is 0 if we're currently subtracting multiplies of a
   from b, and 1 if we're subtracting b from a.

   e is stored in the least significant bit, while a, b and d are
   coded as only 13 distinct values in bits 1-4, according to the
   following table. For rows not mentioning d, the value is either
   implied, or it doesn't matter. */
